📌 What’s Included:
✅ Weekly problem-solving tracker

📂 Solutions in Java (my primary language)

📄 Explanations and approaches for each problem

✍️ Notes on patterns, edge cases, and optimizations

🔗 References to LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks problems

🎯 Focus Areas:
Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs

Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Greedy, Backtracking

Dynamic Programming, Heaps, Tries, Bit Manipulation

System Design (basic level for SDE-1)
